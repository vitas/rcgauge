## List of material for complete gauge set

### 3D printed parts

* 4 pcs 'Winkel'
* 3 pcs 'Klip-und-Halter'
* 4 pcs 'Endkappe'

### Other

* 2 pcs aluminium profile 12,5 x 7,5 mm, length depends on wing size
* M3 nuts and screws

### Sensors

* 2 pcs WitMotion sensors


## How to make a measurement

1. Mount two sensors (1, 2) on main wing gauge
2. Mount wing gauge on main wing
3. Mount tailplane gauge (smaller one) on tailplane, without sensor mounted.
4. Set reference for both sensors to zero (reset). Both sensors shall show 0 deg.
5. Unmount sensor 2, move it carefully to the tailplane and mount it on the tailplane gauge.
6. Measure angles 1 and 2 with the app. Build difference between sensor 1 and 2 angles, which ist the wing incidence for yor plane
with the app. The Diff display option of the app will show the angle difference
