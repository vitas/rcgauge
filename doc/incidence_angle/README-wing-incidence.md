### 3D printed parts

* 4 pcs 'Part1' [STL File](/doc/incidence_angle/thingiverse/files/IncidenceMeter_part1.stl)
* 2 pcs 'Part2' [STL File](/doc/incidence_angle/thingiverse/files/IncidenceMeter_part2.stl)
* 4 pcs 'Screw Holder' [STL File](/doc/incidence_angle/thingiverse/files/screw.stl)

### Other

* 2 pcs aluminium profile 10 x 10 mm, length depends on wing size
* M3 nuts and screws

### How to make a measurement

1. Mount sensors 1 and 2 on same gauge and place gauge horizontally.
2  Calibrate both sensors, both shall show 0 degrees.
3. Mount sensor 1 on wing gauge and sensor 2 on tailplane gauge.
3. Mount wing gauge on main wing.
4. Mount tailplane gauge on tailplane.
5. Measure angles 1 and 2 with the app. Build difference between sensor 1 and 2 angles, which ist the wing incidence for yor plane.
6. The Diff display option of the app will calculate the difference for you.

### 3D printed parts

* 4 pcs 'Winkel' [STL File](/doc/incidence_angle/Winkel.stl)
* 3 pcs 'Klip-und-Halter' [STL File](/doc/incidence_angle/Klip-und-Halter.stl)
* 4 pcs 'Endkappe' [STL File](/doc/incidence_angle/Endkappe.stl)

### Other

* 2 pcs aluminium profile 12,5 x 7,5 mm, length depends on wing size
* M3 nuts and screws



### How to make a measurement

1. Mount two sensors (1, 2) on main wing gauge.
2. Mount wing gauge on main wing.
3. Mount tailplane gauge (smaller one) on tailplane, without sensor mounted.
4. Set reference for both sensors to zero (reset). Both sensors shall show 0 deg.
5. Unmount sensor 2, move it carefully to the tailplane and mount it on the tailplane gauge.
6. Measure angles 1 and 2 with the app. Build difference between sensor 1 and 2 angles, which ist the wing incidence for yor plane.
7. The Diff display option of the app will calculate the difference for you.
